                              The Nampa Fire Protection District has a rich history that dates back to September 1891 when Nampa's first fire station, known as the "Engine House," was established. The original fire station was a single-story, one-room wooden building.<br> 
                              Since its inception, the firefighters of Nampa Fire Protection District have maintained a tradition of service and sacrifice that continues to guide its members today.

                      <p>My personal leadership philosophy is based on the core value of integrity and the "Platinum Rule".
                        I believe that when I do the right things for the right reasons and treat others even better than the way I wish to be treated, it will establish trust, commitment, and connection with those around me.
                        I believe sharing my personal leadership philosophy will help our members develop and understanding of what i expect from them -- and create a framework from which
                        you can hold me accountable. Above all, I believe following these priciples will allow me to positively impact the lives of those around me. My leadership philosophy is a living document
                        which continues to develop as I learn and grow. I will be sure to revisit this philosophy often an update the members of our distric when changes are made.</p>
